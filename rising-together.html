            This is the space for lived truth — experiences that reveal the human side of systems.
            You are not alone. When people share what they’ve lived through, patterns become visible,
            leaders listen differently, and we move closer to healing and change.

                <h3>Stories Reveal What Data Cannot</h3>
                <p>
                    Numbers can show trends, but they cannot show fear, exhaustion, hope, or the everyday
                    experiences that shape our lives. Your story helps complete the picture.

                <h3>Patterns Become Visible Through People</h3>
                <p>
                    Lived experiences help confirm — or challenge — what public data and agency records
                    suggest. When multiple people describe the same struggle, it becomes harder to ignore.

                <h3>Your Truth Has Weight</h3>
                <p>
                    You do not need perfect words or proof. You only need honesty. Every voice is treated 
                    with dignity, and no one is judged for what they’ve been through.
