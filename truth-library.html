                Most decisions that affect your life are driven less by personal morals and more
                by incentives. Budgets, bonuses, votes, career paths, and legal risk all push

                Credit cards, student loans, car loans, medical debt, “buy now pay later.”
                A data map of how debt has replaced wages as the main way people keep up
                with rising costs.

              <p>
                Government spending doesn’t vanish. It flows somewhere—to contractors,
                hospitals, landlords, defense firms, schools, and more. Visualizing those
                flows helps answer “who is really being served?”

              Systems are often described in cold language: “markets,” “efficiency,”
              “incentives.” This room stays with the human side—the stress, the hope,
              and the cost of trying to build a life in these conditions.

                Millions of people are doing “everything right” and still can’t get
                ahead. They work full time (or more), but the math of rent, food,
                childcare, and debt never adds up. This isn’t a personal failure story;
                it’s a structural one.

                Constant financial pressure shows up as anxiety, insomnia, burnout, and
                health problems. When survival takes all your attention, it becomes
                harder to plan, study, rest, or dream.

                When enough individuals are stressed at once, neighborhoods change.

                It’s data. When enough people describe similar experiences, the story
