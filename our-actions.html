            This page summarizes the concrete steps taken to call for lawful, transparent public policy.
            It is written for everyone: residents, advocates, journalists, and officials who want to
            understand what has been done—and what is still coming.

                <h3>From Confusion to Record</h3>
                <p>
                    Many people feel that “something is wrong” in housing, money, education, and health systems,
                    but cannot prove it in a way officials are forced to answer. Formal actions—especially under the
                    Administrative Procedure Act (APA)—turn that intuition into a documented record.

                <h3>Using the Rules, Not Breaking Them</h3>
                <p>
                    The filings described on this page do not bypass the law—they use it. The goal is not to attack
                    any person, but to put lawful pressure on agencies so that policies, data, and decisions can be
                    explained and, when necessary, changed.

                    The Truth Library explains patterns. Our Actions are where those patterns are presented to agencies
                    and courts with specific questions, evidence, and legal arguments. Together, they form a Mirror
                    between lived reality and official records.
